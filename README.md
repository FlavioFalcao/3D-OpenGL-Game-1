3D-OpenGL-Game
==============

This game has been made using the OpenGL library for C++. It is a 3D arcade game in which a character has to traverse a path using jumps and jetpacks to reach the destination. It has a total of 3 levels. This repository contains all the necessary files which are required by the program but you still need to install all the required C++ libraries for proper functioning of the game. Good Luck!
